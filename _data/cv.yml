    - My interests include any aspects of robotics; 
      actually my research focuses in particular on 
      teleoperation and shared control techniques. 
      In university, I studied with great interest many of the 
      basic aspects of robotics such as&#58  artificial intelligence, control, planning, 
      kinematics, linear and non-linear dynamics, computer vision, machine learning, 
      system identification, optimization, real time systems, embedded systems, 
      mobile robots, mechanical drawing.
      I gained hands-on experience with real robots&#58  complex hybrid wheel-legged system 
      <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8630605">CENTAURO</a>, mobile manipulator 
      <a href"=https://relax.comiteg.it/">RELAX</a>, and robotic hands 
      (HERI II, Qb Softhand, Robotiq grippers).

    - I like to learn to resolve things by myself and organize stuff, 
      like for my motorbike servicing and my computer building. 
      I regularly enjoy going to gym and planning my diet. 
      My other interests include reading very long book series and 
      travelling in (almost) any place. Started playing an instrument 
      recently.
