# About

I am a Roboticist Researcher currently working at [HHCM lab](https://hhcm.iit.it/en-US/), [IIT](https://www.iit.it/en-US/home), [Genova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pgYbVC4x6tkYCBFh6), finishing my PhD with [University of Genova](https://biorob.phd.unige.it/). The proof is [Here](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/davide-torielli).  

I work with cool robots trying to make them do what I want. Sometimes, I succeed ([youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT9OgUePJDXWH4lcZZhrPfMZts92yIb38))   

According to my tentative thesis title, _Intuitive Human-Robot Interfaces Leveraging on Autonomy Features for the Control of Highly-redundant Robots_, I am exploring human-robot interfaces to let people operate such highly-redundant robots. The poster [here](https://torydebra.github.io/projects/poster_phd/) could be a good recap. With the HHCM lab, I am involved in different European projects, like H2020 [SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/), H2020 [CONCERT](https://concertproject.eu/), H2020 [HARIA](https://clem.diism.unisi.it/~haria/), and in the Italian MISE founded project [RELAX](https://relax.comiteg.it/). I worked in the ROS End-Effectorâ€¯ROS-Industrial Focused Technical Project [ROSEE ROSIN FTP](https://www.rosin-project.eu/ftp/ros-end-effector).
I published my [works](https://torydebra.github.io/publications/) on journals (RAL, JIRS), and presented them at conferences (ICAR, ICRA, IROS, HUMANOIDS). I have had also the opportunity to partecipate to two ROSCON conferences, [2022](https://roscon.ros.org/2022/), [2023](https://roscon.ros.org/2023/). I love the open-sourceness of the robotic community. 

I like to eat, travel (as everyone I suppose), code stuff (btw, check my conference/school list [website](https://torydebra.github.io/AwesomeRoboticsConferencesAndSchoolsList/)), gym, playing an instrument (actually this since only a few months).
